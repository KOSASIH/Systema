This document contains a list of known issues and limitations in the current version of Systema. Our team is actively working to address these issues in upcoming releases. We appreciate your understanding and patience. If you encounter any of these issues or have additional concerns, please feel free to report them to our development team.

## Issue 1: Inconsistent Weather Data for Remote Regions

**Description:** Some remote regions may experience delays or inconsistencies in weather data retrieval due to limited data sources and connectivity.

**Status:** Under investigation. We are exploring alternative data sources and caching mechanisms to improve data availability for remote regions.

## Issue 2: Delayed Early Warning Alerts

**Description:** In certain situations, there might be a slight delay in delivering early warning alerts to users, especially during periods of high server load.

**Status:** Ongoing optimization efforts are being made to reduce alert delivery times and enhance real-time response.

## Issue 3: Limited Support for Historical Climate Data
